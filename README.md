## How it works

* The constraint targets itself at full weight and another source at a weight lower than one
* This causes a feedback loop where every frame the constraint moves a relative distance towards the target, creating a damping effect

## Install guide

Position Damping Constraint

* Drag & Drop the ``Position Damping Constraint`` prefab into the base of your Hierarchy.
* Right click and unpack the prefab, then drag & drop it onto your avatar.
* Expand the prefab hierarchy and find ``Position Target``
* Move ``Position Target`` outside of ``Position Damping Constraint`` and place it anywhere in your avatars hierarchy as needed.

Rotation Damping Constraint

* Drag & Drop the ``Rotation Damping Constraint`` prefab into the base of your Hierarchy.
* Right click and unpack the prefab, then drag & drop it onto your avatar.
* Expand the prefab hierarchy and find ``Rotation Target``
* Move ``Rotation Target`` outside of ``Rotation Damping Constraint`` and place it anywhere in your avatars hierarchy as needed.

## How to use

* Place the objects you want to dampen inside ``Container``.
  * Alternatively you can constrain the objects to ``Container``.
* Changing the weight of the second source in the constraint will change the strenght of the damping effect.

## Performance stats

```c++
Constraints:        1
